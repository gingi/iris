KBASE WEB
=========
This is a node.js implementation of the web interface to the Kbase project.

REQUIRED MODULES
================
During installation, the app automatically installs other dependencies that it requires. But in order to get to that step, the following need to be installed separately:

    * node.js
		git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
		cd node
		./configure
		make
		sudo make install
    * npm
		git clone https://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
		cd npm
		sudo make install

INSTALLATION
============
$ git clone http://wildcat.cshl.edu/git/kbase-web.git
$ cd kbase-web/nodejs
$ npm install express
$ node app.js
