KBASE WEB
=========
This is the project that serves the web interface to the Kbase project.

REQUIRED MODULES
================
During installation, the app automatically installs other dependencies that it requires ('make installdeps'). But in order to get to that step, the following non-core CPAN modules need to be installed separately:

    * Catalyst
    * Catalyst::Devel
    * Module::Install

INSTALLATION
============
$ git clone http://wildcat.cshl.edu/git/kbase-web.git
$ cd kbase-web
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make installdeps
$ perl script/kbase-server.pl
