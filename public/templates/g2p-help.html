<p>The workbench is designed for seamless visual interaction across various omics data sets within KBase. <a href="#" title="Genome-wide association study">GWAS</a> experiments comprise observations of variation (typically, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-title="single-nucleotide polymorphisms">SNPs</a>) for a set of studied traits. To select an interesting trait, use the drop-down menus to select a <strong>Genome</strong>, followed by an associated <strong>Experiment</strong>, and finally a <strong>Trait</strong> of interest. Once you've selected a trait, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot">Manhattan plot</a> is drawn. The plot shows the distribution of SNP variations at varying significance (Y-axis) across the entire genome (X-axis).</p>
<p><strong>Selecting genes.</strong> Drag a box around a set of highly significant variations to select genes in close proximity (currently within 10,000 bp around each selected variation). The workbench then fetches data associated with those genes:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Internal Network</strong>: Network-based associations among the selected genes.</li>
    <li><strong>Expression Profiles</strong>: Average expression values for the selected genes across several tissue types</li>
    <li><strong>Trait Genes</strong>: A sortable summary table of the selected genes, along with their annotated function and gene ontology (GO) terms. Use the <input type="text" class="mini input-small search-query" placeholder="Search"/> box to filter genes by name or function. The filtered genes are also highlighted in the <strong>Internal Network</strong> widget.</li> 
    <li><strong>GO Enrichment</strong>: A set of highly-enriched gene functions that are common to the set of genes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any of the available widgets, you can export the underlying data by clicking on the gear (<button class="btn btn-mini"><i class="icon-cog"></i></button>) and selecting "<strong>Export data</strong>". You can also rearrange the subviews by dragging them with the <button class="btn btn-mini"><i class="icon-move"></i></button> handle.</p>
<p><strong>Gene Pad.</strong> The Gene Pad allows you to supply your own set of genes to interrogate within KBase. Simply paste a list of gene names and click on the upload <button class="btn btn-primary btn-mini"><i class="icon-upload-alt"></i></button> button. The page can also be saved as a bookmark for sharing with others (<a href="http://0:3000/g2p#genepad/POPTR_0016s07120,POPTR_0009s16600,POPTR_0008s07790,POPTR_0009s15190,POPTR_0001s15810,POPTR_0008s07330,POPTR_0012s10180,POPTR_0017s13990,POPTR_0005s08230">Example</a>).</p>
