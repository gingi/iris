<p>The workbench is designed for seamless visual interaction across various omics data sets within KBase. <a href="#" title="Genome-wide association studies">GWAS</a> experiments comprise observations of variation (typically, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-title="single-nucleotide polymorphisms">SNPs</a>) for a set of studied traits. To select an interesting trait, use the dropdown menus to select a <b>Genome</b>, then an associated <b>Experiment</b>, and finally a <b>Trait</b> of interest. Once you've selected a trait, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot">Manhattan plot</a> is drawn. The Manhattan plot displays the distribution of SNP variations at varying significance (Y-axis) across the entire genome (X-axis).</p>
<p>Drag a box around a set of highly significant variations to select genes in close proximity (currently within 10,000 bp around each selected variation). The workbench then fetches data associated with those genes:
<ul>
    <li><b>Internal Network</b>: Network-based associations among the selected genes.</li>
    <li><b>Expression Profiles</b>: Average expression values for the selected genes across several tissue types</li>
    <li><b>Trait Genes</b>: A summary table of the selected genes, along with their annotated function and gene ontology (GO) terms.
    <li><b>GO Enrichment</b>: A set of highly-enriched gene functions that are common to the set of genes.
</ul>
<p>For any of the available widgets, you can export the underlying data by clicking on the gear and selecting "<b>Export data</b>". You can also rearrange the subviews by dragging them with the arrow handle at the top right.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned! Many new features are in the works.</em></p>
