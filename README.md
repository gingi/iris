Iris
====
A web application for exploration of biological data

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
---------------------
The following tools need to be installed separately (e.g., with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)) before Iris and its dependencies can be installed:

* node (nodejs.org)
* git (git-scm.com)
* gcc
* mongodb (mongodb.org)

OVERVIEW
--------
Iris is equipped with a command-line tool, quaintly named `iris`, to manage the project. It can be used to install dependencies, start Iris and it services, monitor Iris, and shut it down.

To use the tool, run:

    source iris.env

INSTALLATION
------------
To install Iris, along with its dependencies, run:

    iris install
    
To check the installation, and execute project tests, run:

    iris check
    
To install example data used by the demo, run:

    iris examples
    
CONFIGURATION
-------------
Iris services are configured in a simple configuration file in `conf/services.json` listing an HTTP port, the name of the service, the Node.js control file, and a configuration file. A sample services configuration is available at `conf/services-sample.json`. To get started:

    cp conf/services-sample.json conf/services.json

RUNNING IRIS
------------
To start Iris, run:

    iris start
    
All the services configured in `conf/services.json` are started. Their process IDs and network ports are listed.

To stop Iris, run:

    iris stop
    
To restart Iris, run:

    iris restart
    
To determine whether Iris and its services are running, run:

    iris status
    
Each of the above management commands can be run on individual services by supplying the service name as an argument:

    iris {start,stop,restart,status} <service-name>
    
MORE HELP
---------
The `iris` tool has a general and command-specific help facility. To find out more about it, run:

    iris help [<command>]


PROJECT STRUCTURE
-----------------
The Iris server is run out of `/nodejs`. `/nodejs` also contains the Express
routes (`app.js` and `routes/`) and Jade templates (`views/`).

Client-side rendering code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) is organized under `/root`. All client-side Javascript is in `/root/js`. The `widgets/` directory contains the widget code, while all utility, administrative, and external scripts (`jquery.js`, `bootstrap`) should be placed at the Javascript root.

The Fastbit source code, including pristine and Iris-specific is under the `/fastbit` directory, but compiled artifacts are placed in folders at the root directory (`/bin`, `/lib`, `/share`, `/include`).

NOTES
-----
All the conventions above are so far tentative and up for discussion.
