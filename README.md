# Iris
**Version 0.1.2**

A web library for data visualization and exploration.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gingi/iris.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gingi/iris)

##External Dependencies
The following tools need to be installed separately (e.g., with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)) before Iris and its dependencies can be installed:

* [Node.js](nodejs.org)
* [Git](git-scm.com)
* [Cairo](http://cairographics.org) (*for testing only*)

##Overview
Iris is equipped with a command-line tool, quaintly named `iris`, to manage the project. It can be used to install dependencies, start Iris and it services, monitor Iris, and shut it down.

To use the tool, run:

    source iris.env

##Installation
To install Iris, along with its dependencies, run:

    iris install

To check the installation, and execute project tests, run:

    iris check

To install example data used by the demo, run:

    iris examples

##Configuration
Iris services are configured in a simple configuration file in `conf/services.json` listing an HTTP port, the name of the service, the Node.js control file, and a configuration file. A sample services configuration is available at `conf/services-sample.json`. To get started:

    cp conf/services-sample.json conf/services.json

##Running Iris
To start Iris, run:

    iris start

All the services configured in `conf/services.json` are started. Their process IDs and network ports are listed.

To stop Iris, run:

    iris stop

To restart Iris, run:

    iris restart

To determine whether Iris and its services are running, run:

    iris status

Each of the above management commands can be run on individual services by supplying the service name as an argument:

    iris {start,stop,restart,status} <service-name>

##More Help
The `iris` tool has a general and command-specific help facility. To find out more about it, run:

    iris help [<command>]

##Project Structure
The Iris server is run out of `/nodejs`. `/nodejs` also contains the Express
routes (`app.js` and `routes/`) and Jade templates (`views/`).

Client-side rendering code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) is organized under `/root`. All client-side Javascript is in `/root/js`. The `widgets/` directory contains the widget code, while all utility, administrative, and external scripts (`jquery.js`, `bootstrap`) should be placed at the Javascript root.

The Snapdragon source code, including pristine and Iris-specific is under the `/snapdragon` directory, but compiled artifacts are placed in folders at the root directory (`/bin`, `/lib`, `/share`, `/include`).

## Library Deployment
The client-side JavaScript libraries that drive all the visualizations are managed in separate module files using RequireJS, but they can be packaged into a single library that can be dropped into any page. To build that library, run

    make dist

Which will, by default, create a minified library as '`dist/iris.js`'. To specify a different output file for the library, use the `DISTLIB=/path/to/target.js`. To avoid minification (useful for debugging), add `MINIFY=0`. For example, to create a non-optimized library as `/tmp/foo.js`, run:

    make dist MINIFY=0 DISTLIB=/tmp/foo.js


## Visualization Example
The client-side library can be used on the browser as in the following example:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="iris.css" type="text/css">
        <script src="iris.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script>
            iris.require(['charts/bar'], function (Chart) {
                var chart = new Chart({
                    element: "body",
                    // other options
                });
                chart.setData([ /* Data here */ ]);
                chart.render();
            });
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
