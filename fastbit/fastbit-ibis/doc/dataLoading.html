<H2>Overview</H2>
<p class=standout>
In <A HREF="quickstart.html">quickstart.html</A>, a brief intruction for
the loading data into FastBit was given.  In this document, we give
further details for those who want to know the internal structures in
order to make more extensive uses of FastBit.</p>

<p style="font-size:small; text-align: right;">
<A HREF="http://lbl.gov/%7Ekwu/fastbit/data/samples.html">Sample data
  and usage examples</A>
</p>

<p>
Recall that FastBit stores a data table in multiple partitions and each
partition is stored in one directory on the file system.  Next, we will
first briefly describe how to use <code>ardea</code> to to create this
directory, then give more details of the files in this directory, and
finally end with some advices on how different functions can be used to
integrate data into existing tables.

<H2>Using Existing Command Line Tools</H2>
<p>
Starting with ASCII form of data in the Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
format, there is a command line tool named <code>ardea</code> that can
digest the data and create the raw binary files and metadata files for
FastBit.  Very briefly, a CSV file contains values of a data table in
ASCII format with commas (and possibly white spaces) as delimiters.  It
has all columns of a row on one line, and usually does not contain
neither names of the columns or types of the columns.  Therefore it is
necessary to supply this information from elsewhere.  The executable
<code>ardea</code> has four options that deals with reading CSV data.

<ul>
<li><code>-d output-dir</code><br>

Specifies the output directory to contain the data partition generated.
Only one <code>-d</code> option is expected, if multiple of them are
specified, the last one overwrite all previous ones.

<li><code>-n name-of-partition</code><br>

Specifies the name of the data partition.  If a name is not specified,
it will keep the name of the existing data in the output directory,
however, if the output directory is empty, it will use the directory
name.  If the directory name is '.' or '..', then it will use a digest
of the time stamp and size information as the name of the data
partition.

<li><code>-m name:type[, name:type, ...]</code><br>

Specifies the names and types of the columns.  The names and types given
here must in the same order as the columns in the CSV file.  When multiple
option <code>-m</code> are specified, they are concatenated together.

<li><code>-t text-filename</code><br>

Specifies the name of the text file to be read.  Multiple
<code>-t</code> options may be used to specify multiple text files.

<li><code>-r a-row-in-text-form</code><br>
Specifies a single row of a table in ASCII form.  Multiple rows may be
specified by using multiple <code>-r</code> options.  In
<code>ardea</code> text files are processed before individual rows
specified by option <code>-r</code>.
</ul>

Regarding column names, FastBit imposes the following restrictions.  The
same restriction also apply to names of data partitions.
<A name="colname"></A>
<ul>
<li> Column names must be composed from alphanumeric characters plus
underscore, parentheses, brackets.
<li> Column names must start with an alphabet or a underscore.
<li> Column names are case-insensitive.
</ul>

Following the above specification, some examples of valid column names
are "col1", "c0ll" and "c01l" (clearly they are too confusing and should
not be used).  Some examples of invalid names are "6e5", "e-f", and
"e.f".  Note also that columns named "name" and "NaMe" are treated as a
single column.

<p>
The executable <code>ardea</code> supports a subset of the data types
that are supported by query processing functions.  The following is a
complete list of data types supported by <code>ardea</code>

<A name="types"></A>
<ul>
<li><code>byte</code>: 8-bit signed integer.
<li><code>short</code>: 16-bit signed integer.
<li><code>int</code>: 32-bit signed integer.
<li><code>long</code>: 64-bit signed integer.
<li><code>unsigned byte</code>: unsigned 8-bit signed integer.
<li><code>unsigned short</code>: unsigned 16-bit signed integer.
<li><code>unsigned int</code>: unsigned 32-bit signed integer.
<li><code>unsigned long</code>: unsigned 64-bit signed integer.
<li><code>float</code>: 32-bit IEEE floating-point values.
<li><code>double</code>: 64-bit IEEE floating-point values.
<li><code>key</code>: String values with a small number of distinct choices.
<li><code>text</code>: Arbitrary string values.
</ul>

Except the unsigned integer types, all other types start with a
different letter and <code>ardea</code> only test the first letter in
these cases.  The first letter can be in either upper or lower case.
Therefore the example given
in <A HREF="quickstart.html">quickstart.html</A> can be shorten slightly
as

<pre>
examples/ardea -d tmp -m "a:i,b:f,c:s" -t tests/test0.csv
</pre>

<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: String values containing blank spaces must quoted because
blank space is assumed to be delimiter as well.

<p>
If the data directory specified in <code>-d</code> option already
contains some data, the new rows are appended to the existing records.
If there is any mismatching in column names, NULL values will be used to
pad the rows.  If there is any mismatching in the data types, the new
data type will be used and the existing records will be left unchanged.
Only differences of between signed integer and unsigned integers are
allowed, other mismatches will be flagged and nothing will be written.</p>

<p>
The CSV files in directory <code>tests</code> are not exactly the
standard CSV files, they contain an extra header line in each file.  The
command <code>ardea</code> skips them because they can not be properly
parsed into the data types specified.  These header lines are here to
help the program in directory <code>tests</code> named
<code>readcsv</code>.  In most cases, the CSV files produced by other
systems will not have this extra header line.  We mention the program
<code>readcsv</code> because it could serve as an example for those who
want write their own program to read data for FastBit.  The source code
for <code>readcsv</code> is <code>tests/readcsv.cpp</code>.


<H2>Files in a Data Partition</H2>
In a directory containing a data partition, there are files for each
column and the metadata file named <code>-part.txt</code>.  For example,
after building the indexes in the directory <code>tmp</code> generated
by the above commend, we have the following files,
<pre>
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users  402 Aug  3 20:35 -part.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users  400 Aug  3 20:35 a
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users 3520 Aug  4 23:14 a.idx
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users  400 Aug  3 20:35 b
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users 3520 Aug  4 23:14 b.idx
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users  200 Aug  3 20:35 c
-rw-r--r-- 1 kwu Users 3520 Aug  4 23:14 c.idx
</pre>

In this listing, we see three files with the column names we've given on
the command line <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.  The
metadata file <code>-part.txt</code> and three index files named
<code>a.idx</code>, <code>b.idx</code> and <code>c.idx</code>.  Each
index file contains all information necessary to reconstruct a bitmap
index, including the bitmaps and the keyvalues associated with each
bitmap.  As described in <A
HREF="http://lbl.gov/~kwu/ps/LBNL-62756.html">LBNL-62756</A>, the
bitmaps and the keyvalues are densely packed.  This design allows us to
answer typicaly range queries efficiently.  The specific details of each
bitmap index is documented with the function <code>write</code> in each
index class.</p>

<p>
In addition to the above files, there are a few other files that FastBit
uses.  If one plans to share the FastBit data directory with other
applications, make sure none of them use the same names as FastBit.

<ul>
<li><code>-part.txt</code>: the metadata file for a data partition.
During certain operations, FastBit may store additional information into
this file.  If you have a pre-release version of FastBit, this file may
be called <code>table.tdc</code>.

<li><code>colname</code>: name of the data file for a column.  Note that
column names can not contain dot (.) or space, see <A
HREF="#colname">full list of restrictions</A>.

<li><code>colname.idx</code>: name of the index file associated with
column <code>colname</code>.  There can be one index for each column
following this naming convention.

<li><code>colname.msk</code>: the bit vector containing the mask for
null values of the column.  The <code>i</code>th bit of this vector is
set to <code>1</code> if the value of this column is not null.

<li><code>colname.bin</code>: a reorder version of the values.  When
values are binned, it is possible to generate this file to speed up
certain search operations.

<li><code>colname.sp</code>: starting positions of strings in the raw
data file of string valued column.  Note that the raw string values are
stored one after another along with their null terminators.  This file
contains information to speed up the reading specific string from the
raw data file.

<li><code>colname.tdlist</code>: the term-document list used to build
index <code>ibis::keywords</code>.  In this context, it is assumed that
each row of this column is assumed to text document.

<li><code>colname.terms</code>: terms defined in
<code>colname.tdlist</code>.  This file is always used together with
<code>colname.idx</code>.

<li><code>colname.dic</code>: the dictionary of a low cardinality
string-valued column.  The low cardinality string-valued columns, also
known as "categorical values", are essentially treated as an integer
column by translating each distinct string value to an integer.

<li><code>colname.int</code>: the integers version of the categorical
values (translated through the dictionary).

</ul>

Most of these files are output files used by FastBit, if a file with the
same existing in the directory for the data partition, it is likely to
be overwritten or removed by FastBit.</p>

<p>
To convert data from another format to be used by FastBit, the key data
files to produce are <code>-part.txt</code> and the binary data files
for columns.  Next, we describe the content of these files.

<h2>Conversion to binary data</h2>

Overall, FastBit views user data as tables consisting of rows and
columns.  This is similar to most common database systems.  What is
different is that it organizes column of the data in its own binary
file.  In contrast, most existing database management systems organizes
data of each row together.  A typical layout of data table on paper is
to show the rows horizontally and the columns vertically, thus the
common data layout is known as the horizontal organization and our
column-oriented organization is known as the vertical organization.  The
vertical organization ensures that only homogeneous data is in a file,
which reduce access overhead in many data warehousing type of
applications.

<p>
Unless your data happen to be in vertically organized binary files,
you will have to do a conversion.  The conversion process basically
reads the data in its original format and produce a copy in raw binary
form, with each column going to its own file.
The following are all the necessary requirements.

<ol>
<li> All files to be appended to one data partition shall be in directory.

<li> The <code>i</code>th data value of each data file forms the
<code>i</code>th row of the table.  Therefore, they must be all from the
<code>i</code>th row.

<li> Write all data values in raw binary format.  The string values are
to be written as raw bytes with null terminators and an empty string
must have a null terminator.

<li> An ASCII file named <code>-part.txt</code> that describes the
data files in the directory.  The required information includes
<ul>
<li> Number of rows in the directory.
<li> Number of columns in the directory.
<li> Names of the columns.
<li> Data types of the columns.
</ul>
<A HREF="#types">Currently supported data types are given above</A>.
</ol>

<p>
We mentioned two examples program for converting ASCII data into
vertically partitioned raw binary data files before,
<code>tests/readcsv.cpp</code> and <code>examples/readcsv.cpp</code>.
One may follow these examples to develop new one.


<h2>Appending new data to an existing table</h2>

FastBit IBIS implementation was initially designed to run as a server.
To minimize the down time while appending new data, it maintains two
copies of the same data and it performs the append operation in three
steps:

<ol>

<li> First, the new data is appended to a backup copy of the active data
directory.

<li> The role of the backup directory and the active directory is
swapped.  This is the only time the clients have to be locked out and
the operation itself takes negligible amount of time.

<li> The user may perform some integrity tests on the newly combined
data and choose either to rollback the append operation or commit it.

</ol>

During an append operation, three directories are used, a directory to
hold the new data, an active directory that can be used to answer user
queries and a backup directory for accepting new data.  If there is no
more rows to be added, the backup directory is never used again and can
be removed.

A configuration file is required to tell FastBit where are various
resources such the data directory and the backup directory.  These
directories can be specified as follows,

<pre>
dataDirectory = full-path-to-the-data-directory
backupDirectory = full-path-to-the-backup-directory
</pre>

A <A href="#samplerc">sample configuration file</A> can be found at the
end of this document.  Typically, the <code>dataDirectory</code> is a
parent directory that contains the directories for different partitions,
where each partition is stored in its own directory.  In particular, if a
new partition is created, it is created as a new directory under the
<code>dataDirectory</code>.

<p>
If a configuration file is not specified, the new data will appear in a
directory named <code>.ibis</code> in the current working directory.

<h3>Appending data through <code>ibis</code> command line tool</h3>
Using the <code>ibis</code> command line tool, this three steps can be
performed with one invocation using the <em>-a</em> option.  This option
takes one mandatory arguments, which is the name of the directory
containing the data to be appended.  It also take two optional arguments
in the form of <em>to table_name</em>, where the word
<em>table_name</em> is the name of a table the new data is to be
appended.  The word <em>to</em> is used to make the command line
slightly more friendly.

<h3>Appending data through <code>ibis::part</code> API</h3> The
operation of appending new data to the backup directory and swapping the
roles of the active directory and the backup directory is performed in
one function named <code>append</code>.  It has the following
definition.

<pre>
int ibis::part::append(const char *newDataDir);
</pre>

This function returns the number of rows appended if it is successful,
otherwise it returns an negative values as error code.

<p>
The function to perform the integrity check is called
<code>selfTest</code>, which is defined as follows,

<pre>
int ibis::part::selfText(int numThreads=0, const char *prefix=0) const;
</pre>
This function performs a set of predefined tests and return the number
of failures encountered.  The function may take two arguments.  The
first is the number of threads to be used and the second is a prefixed
used to get extra control information from the configuration files.
Both arguments to this function are optional.

<p>
If the integrity tests went fine, one may commit the append operation by
calling <code>commit</code>, which has the following definition.

<pre>
int ibis::part::commit(const char *newDataDir);
</pre>

Similar to function <code>append</code>, this function returns the
number of rows appended or an negative error code.

<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: The argument to <code>commit</code> should be the
same as the argument to <code>append</code>.

<p>
If the append operation failed the integrity tests, one may rollback the
append operation by calling <code>rollback</code>.

<pre>
int ibis::part::rollback();
</pre>

This function either return the number of rows removed or an negative
number indicating error.

<h3>Append data without the backup directory</h3>

By only specifying the active data directory for a partition, it is
possible to call <code>ibis::part::append</code> to work without the
backup directory.  Of course, the function <code>commit</code> and
<code>rollback</code> would do nothing.  If the <code>append</code>
operation failed, one will have to do a manual recovery.  FastBit does
not have to a tool to automate this recovery at this point in time.

</p>

<p><B>Warning:</B> The number of rows in each data patition is recorded
with a 32-bit integer, which limits the maximum number of rows in a data
partition to be 2<sup>32</sup> (~ 4 billion).  However, here are a
number of more limitations on the number of rows that should be put in a
data partition.
<ul>
  <li> Each column is loaded into memory when the raw data is needed.
  If your machine has 2GB of memory, then the maximum number of rows in
  a data partition with 8-byte double-precision floating-point values is
  250 million.</li>
  <li> In order to build an index, both the raw data and the index must
  fit in the memory.  This imposes an even lower upper bound on the
  number of rows in a data partition.  To be safe, we assume the index
  size is going to take 5N words, where N is the number of rows in the
  partition.  Due to memory fragmentation, these 5N words might actually
  occupy an address space of size 10N words.  Therefore, we typically
  partition data so that each column takes no more than one-tenth of the
  memory.</li>
  <!--li> Even if you have a machine is very large amount of memory, there
  is another limitation due to the size of the word used to record the
  positions of the bitmaps in a data file.  The positions are recorded
  using 32-bit integers, therefore, the maximum size of an index is
  2<sup>32</sup> bytes (~ 4GB).  If the index file has more than 4GB, at
  least one of the bitmaps will not be reconstructed correctly.  One may
  observe intermittent errors or incorrect answers in this situation.</li-->
  <li> Currently the result table of a query is stored in memory.  This
  places an upper bound on how many rows can be stored in such a table.</li>
</ul>
