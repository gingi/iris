<H1>Options for building bitmap indexes</H1>

<DIV style="width: 18em; float: right; align: right; border-width: 0px; margin: 1em;">
<form action="http://www.google.com/cse" id="cse-search-box">

<p>
The process of building a bitmap index is conceptually divided into
three steps, binning, encoding, and compressing.  The options for each
of these steps are controlled separately.  The options string has the
following format
<pre>
index=&lt;binning ... /&gt; &lt;encoding ... /&gt; &lt;compressing ... /&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: all keywords, such as binning, encoding and compressing,
should be written lower case.
</p><p>
<em>NOTE</em>: do not leave any space between keywords and the equal sign (=)
following them.
</p>
<H3>Binning Options</H3> The basic idea of bitmap index is to generate
one bitmap to represent the presence of each distinct value.  This
strategy is generally regarded as efficient for attributes with low
cardinalities.  For attributes with high cardinalities, one way to
reduce the number of bitmaps is to bin the values and produce one bitmap
for each bin.  The value of <code>&lt;binning /&gt;</code> option can be
one of the following where the separator can be either space or comma
and no space is allowed around equal signs

<DL>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>none</code>

<dd> Don't use bins, produce one bitmap for each distinct attribute
      value.

<dd> <em>NOTE</em>: leaving binning option blank (<code>&lt;binning
      /&gt;</code>) or not specifying the option is equivalent to have
      <code>&lt;binning nbins=10000 /&gt;</code>, which causes 10000
      nearly-equal-weight bins to be used.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>[nbins=xxx, ]binFile="xxx"</code>

<dd>  Read the bin boundaries from the named file.  If nbins is not
      specified, all the values are read.  If nbins is specified, read
      nbins of the values unless the end-of-file is reached.

<dd> <em>NOTE</em>: The file name should be quoted.  Unquoted file name
      can not have any special character such as '/', '&gt;', ',', ' '
      and ';'.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>nbins=xxx, equal-weight</code>

<dd> Generate equal-weight bins, i.e., each bin would have the same
     number of records (or as close to equal as possible).  The number
     of bins is specified by <code>nbins</code>.  This options will
     cause the data to be scanned twice once for generating the
     histogram and once to actually build the index.  To allow the
     software to sample the data instead of building the full histogram,
     omit '<code>equal-weight</code>'.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>precision=dd</code>

<dd> Generate bins corresponding to the reduced precision floating-point
     numbers.  The bin boundaries will have <code>dd</code> significant
     digits.  Any queries involving constants with no more than
     <code>dd</code> significant digits will be answered precisely with
     this index.  Queries involving constants with more than
     <code>dd</code> significant digits will not be full answered with
     the index.  FastBit will have to scan the base data to fully
     resolve them.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>start=xxx, end=xxx, nbins=xxx, scale=linear|log|simple</code>

<dd> Dividing the range <code>[start, end]</code> into
     <code>nbins</code> either using log scale or linear scale.  If
     scale is not specified, it is assumed to be linear, unless start
     and end are specified and are both positive and <code>start &lt;
     end/nbins</code>.  In which case, scale is assumed to be
     logarithm.  This assumption is reasonable since the user has gone
     through the trouble of specifying a small start value which
     otherwise can more conveniently be expressed as zero.

<dd> If either <code>start</code> or <code>end</code> is missing, we
     scan the data once to determine the actual minimum and maximum
     value.  If end is not specified, it will be the maximum value, if
     the start is not specified, it will be the minimum value.  For
     integer variables, if <code>(end-start) &lt; nbins</code>, each
     integer value would be placed in its own bin.  Two additional bins
     are also generated, one for values less than start and the other
     for values larger than end.

<dd> Following C/C++ convention, the range <code>[start, end]</code>
     includes <code>start</code> but excludes <code>end</code>.  Each
     bin also has the same convention, i.e., it includes the left
     boundary but excludes the right boundary.  The only exception is
     the left most bin which is defined to be everything less than
     <code>start</code>.  All fields in the format are optional.  If
     <code>nbins</code> is not specified, it is assumed to be 10,000.

<dd> If the '<code>scale</code>' option is not specified, the current
     software samples about 100 data points per bin and generates a set
     of equal-weight bins based on the sampled data.  To get the basic
     equal-width bins, "<code>scale=linear</code>" must be specified.

<dd> The values of <code>scale</code> field is parsed as follows.  If
     the first letter after the equal sign is 'l' or 'L', the value is
     assumed to either 'linear' or 'log'.  If the second letter is 'o'
     or 'O', it will be treated as 'log', otherwise, it is assumed to
     be 'linear'.  If '<code>scale=</code>' is present, but the letter
     following the equal sign is not 'l', then the option is assumed to
     be '<code>scale=simple</code>'.  With '<code>linear</code>' and
     '<code>log</code>' options, the current software attempts to
     generate bin boundaries that have short decimal point
     representation.  The option '<code>simple</code>' tell the
     software to generate a simpler equal-width bin boundaries without
     attempting to reduce the decimal representation of the bin
     boundaries.

<dd> <em>NOTE</em>: no space is allowed around the equal size.  The
     keywords '<code>start</code>', '<code>end</code>',
     '<code>nbins</code>' and '<code>scale</code>' must be spelled as
     shown here.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>(start, end, nbins, scale)(start, end, nbins, scale)...</code>

<dd> This form is a generalization of the above one.  For each range
     <code>[start, end)</code>, it generates <code>nbins</code> if
     possible.  The values <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> must
     be specified.  The default value for <code>nbins</code> in this
     case is one (1) and the default value for <code>scale</code> is
     <code>linear</code>.

<dd> It is possible to neglect the keywords in this form, i.e., there is
     not need to say <code>(start=x1, end=x2, nbins=n1,
     scale=linear)</code>, but simply <code>(x1, x2, n1,
     linear)</code>.  The restriction is that the four fields must
     appear in the above order.  </DL>
<p>
When binning is used, it is possible to also produce a set of file
containing reordered values (according to the bin number) so as to
reduce the time required for candidate check.  Add
'<code>reorder</code>' to the binning specification to invoke this
option.  At this point, reorder only works with 1-component equality
encoding and 1-component range encoding.
</p>

<H3>Bitmap Encoding Options</H3>
After the values are divided into bins, the next step is to encode values
as bitmaps.  The simplest encoding scheme is to have one bitmap for
each bin.  In this case, a bit value of one (1) indicates an entry is in
a specified bin.  The current bitmap indexing software supports a number
of different encoding schemes.
<dl>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>equality</code>

<dd> The equality encoding.  The basic bitmap indexing scheme proposed
     is a bitmap index with no binning and equality encoding.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>range</code>

<dd> This encoding scheme uses the same number of bitmaps as the
     equality encoding, but is designed to make range queries more
     efficiently.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>interval</code>

<dd> This encoding scheme uses about half as many bitmaps as equality
     encoding, and is also efficient for range queries.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>ncomp=ddd</code>

<dd> The above three encoding schemes can take <code>ncomp</code> as the
     secondary option to indicate the number of components in the
     encoding.  When this option is not specified, the number of
     components is taken to be one.  The maximum number of components
     is the logarithm of the number of bins, which leads to binary
     encoding.  However, the special implementation of the binary
     encoding has further optimization to take advantage of the fact
     that every component has basis size of two.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>equality-equality</code>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>interval-equality</code>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>range-equality</code>

<dd> Two-level bitmap encodings.  Use the equality encoding at the fine
     level to control the index size; use a coarse level to reduce the
     number of bitmaps accessed to answer a query.

</dl>

<H3>Compression Options</H3>
After the bitmaps are constructed, compression may be applied.
Currently, the bitmaps are compressed at construction time.  Options are
provided to uncompress them.  Valid options are
<dl>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>uncompressDenseBitmaps [density&gt;ddd]</code>

<dd> Uncompress those bitmaps with bit density greater than the
     specified value.  If a density is not specified, it is assumed to
     be 1/8, i.e., if more than one in eight bits are one, then the
     bitmap is uncompressed.  In some cases, decompressing dense bitmaps
     may improve overall query processing speed.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>uncompressLargeBitmaps [compratio&gt;ddd]</code>

<dd> Uncompress those bitmaps with compression ratio greater than the
     specified value.  If the compression value is not specified, it is
     assumed to be 0.75, i.e., if the compressed bitmap takes more than
     three quarters of the space of the uncompressed one, uncompress it.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>uncompressAll</code>

<dd> Uncompress all bitmaps.  Used only for debugging purposes.

</dl>
It is usually a good idea to leave out the compression option and let
the software compress all the bitmaps.

<H3>Additional options</H3>
There is a set of options in the form of 'index=xxx', most of which
should be considered deprecated.  However, some of them are very useful.
The following is a short list.

<dl>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=none</code>

<dd> DO NOT use any index.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=basic</code>

<dd> Equivalent to index=&lt;binning none/&gt;.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=binary</code>

<dd> The binary encoding scheme.  In this case, a bin number is
     represented in a binary form, and each bit of the binary value is
     placed in a bitmap.  This encoding scheme uses the minimal number of
     bitmaps.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=bak2 [precision=p]</code>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=bak [precision=p]</code>

<dd> Generate bins where each bin contains the values that rounds the
     same value.  For example, if the precision is 2 (the default value
     if the precision is not specified), then the values in each bin
     will have the same 2-digit decimal value after rounding.  These
     bins can be generated with one-pass through the data and are useful
     in data with a wide range of distributions.

<dd> The difference between '<code>bak</code>' and '<code>bak2</code>'
    is that '<code>bak2</code>' splits each bin produced by
    '<code>bak</code>' in two so that the 2-digit decimal value itself
    is a bin boundary.  Normally, one should use '<code>bak2</code>'
    rather than '<code>bak</code>'.

<dd> This option is superseded by <code>&lt;binning
     precision=d/&gt;</code>.

<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=bin/bin</code>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=bin/range</code>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=range/bin</code>
<DT>&#8226;&nbsp;<code>index=range/range</code>

<dd> These four options are left over from an attempt to generate
     multi-level bitmap indexes.  They are two-level schemes that uses
     different encoding schemes with each level.

<dd> Use <code>&lt;encoding equality-equality/&gt;</code>,
     <code>&lt;encoding interval-equality/&gt;</code> or
     <code>&lt;encoding range-equality/&gt;</code> instead.

</dl>

<H4>Options for building a keyword index</H4>

A keyword index may be built for a string column (not for categorical
values).  Currently, this keyword index is built from a .tdlist file
that contains term-document matrix in the form of 
<pre>
term: docid, docid, docid
</pre>

Since the document identifiers (docid) are provided as values only,
FastBit needs to know the column name of the document ids to correctly
translate the tdlist into bitmaps.  The recommended way to specify the
name of document identifier is to use an index entry in file
<code>-part.txt</code>, such as

<pre>
index=keywords, docidname=mid
</pre>

<b>Note</b>: the document identifiers must be 4-byte integers.  If the
docidname field is not specified, the integer values in the
term-document list are taken to be the row numbers (starting from 0).
This alternative option can be potentially faster because it requires
less internal lookups to map the ids to bitmaps, but it is less
flexible.  For example, if you reorder the data or delete some rows, the
term-document list will be wrong.

<p>
Alternatively, the docidname may be specified in an RC file (say,
ibis.rc) in the form of
<pre>
table-name.column-name.docIDName=mid
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note about unbinned indexes</b>:  If the explicit minimum and
maximum values are known, FastBit IBIS implementation may be able to
avoid storing the distinct values.  This feature is implemented through
ibis::direkte and is invoked through ibis::index::create.
</p>

<A name="suggestions"><H3>Some Suggestions</H3></A>
<ol>
<li>Before you try to specify any explicit indexing options, just leave
it blank or not specified any indexing options at all.  This invokes the
default options in FastBit, which has been tuned to some extend and can
work reasonably well.</li>
<br>

<p>The key parameter to consider when deciding what indexing option to
use is the column cardinality, which we will simply call cardinality in
the following.</p>
<li>If the cardinality of a column is no more than 100, the binning
option should be <code>none</code>.  The following two might be
reasonable choices.
<pre>
&lt;binning none/&gt;&lt;encoding interval/&gt;
&lt;binning none/&gt;&lt;encoding equality/&gt;
</pre>
The main trade-off between them is that the interval encoding is better
suited for range conditions, while the equality encoding is better
suited for equality conditions.  If you know your query conditions, then
you can pick the one or the other.  However, if you don't what type of
query conditions are going to be used, use interval encoding is a
reasonable choice.  On the other hand, if you are always going to deal
with one-sided range conditions, such as "A < 5" or "A >= 10", then it
is best to use the range encoding
<pre>
&lt;binning none/&gt;&lt;encoding range/&gt;
</pre>
In short, if you have a situation where the cardinality is very low,
you can choose an encoding based on your query workload.
</li>

<li>If the cardinality is less than say 1 million (more precisely, N/10,
where N is the number of rows), our recommendation is
<pre>
&lt;binning none/&gt;&lt;encoding interval-equality/&gt;
</pre>
This option has been proven to be quite effective in tests and analyses.
</li>

<li>If the cardinality is higher than 1 million, we recommend
<pre>
&lt;binning none&gt;&lt;encoding binary/&gt;
</pre>
This produces what is known as the bit-sliced index.  Alternatively, you
may bin the values, a situation we will considered next.
</li>

<li>For floating-point values, it is most likely you don't know exactly
what is the column cardinality.  In this case, it is natural to assume
the cardinality is very high, and bin the values.  Next, we discuss two
reasonable approaches to binning, one is to specify the number of bins,
and the other to specify the precision of the bins.  Of course it is
also possible to tell FastBit exactly where to put the bin boundaries as
indicated above.

<p>
If you specify the number of bins, e.g.,
<pre>
&lt;binning nbins=2000/&gt;&lt;encoding interval-equality/&gt;
</pre>
then FastBit builds a set of approximate equal-weight bins, i.e., each
bin will contain approximate the same number of rows.  This minimize the
worst case behavior during query answering.  This is appropriate if you
don't know what the query conditions are going to be like.  However, if
you do know something about the query conditions, for example, the
precision of the constants used in the query expressions, then the next
option is better.
</p>
<p>
If the constants in the query conditions always have a relatively small
number of significant digits, for example, the following query
conditions use constants with 2 significant digits, "A > 1.5e6" or "A <
9.6E-3", in which case, the following binning specification will
guarantee all such query conditions be answered using index only
(therefore fast).
<pre>
&lt;binning precision=2/&gt;&lt;encoding interval-equality/&gt;
</pre>
</p>
</li>
