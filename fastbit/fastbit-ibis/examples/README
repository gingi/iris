This directory contains a few relative simple examples.

ibis.cpp -- this program demonstrates how to use the lower-level data
	partitions directly.   This is also the program used for
	tests defined in directory ../tests.

thula.cpp -- this program demonstrates how to use the ibis::table
	interface.  It can only perform queries.

ardea.cpp -- this program demonstrates how to use the ibis::tablex
	interface to add new data records.  It supports additions of
	data both through columns and rows, but does not support
	queries.

tcapi.c -- this program demonstrates how to use the C API for accessing
	FastBit functions.  Since it requires a C++ compiler to make an
	executable, it is a not particularly useful in itself.  However,
	it is useful for exporting FastBit functions to other languages.
